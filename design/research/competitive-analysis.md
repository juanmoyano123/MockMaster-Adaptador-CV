## Market Positioning Opportunities

### Gap Analysis

1. **The Analysis-Action Gap**
   - Jobscan tells you WHAT to fix, not HOW
   - Users spend 10+ minutes manually implementing suggestions
   - MockMaster fills this with automated implementation

2. **The Manual Customization Gap**
   - Teal requires manual toggle for each job
   - Power users want speed, not granular control
   - MockMaster automates the entire adaptation

3. **The Template-Optimization Gap**
   - Builders focus on looks, not ATS performance
   - Analysis tools focus on score, not output
   - MockMaster combines both

### Differentiation Strategy

MockMaster should position as:
- **Category:** AI Resume Adaptation Engine
- **Key Differentiator:** From job description to adapted resume in 60 seconds
- **Against Jobscan:** "We don't just analyze - we deliver"
- **Against Teal:** "No manual toggles - one click adaptation"
- **Against Builders:** "Every resume optimized for the specific job"
